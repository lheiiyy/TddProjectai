# SVMI — Project Status

Last updated: 2026-09-23, by this documentation-compliance pass. See
`PROJECT_MEMORY.md` for orientation and `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md` for the
full phase-by-phase history behind this summary.

## What is SVMI?

A Google Sheets + Apps Script application for logging store visits and
administering the rules (risk scoring, compliance cadence, KPI tracking,
reporting) that govern how those visits are evaluated — with a growing,
versioned, audited Admin Configuration layer replacing informal
spreadsheet edits. See `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## What architecture is currently live?

The Apps Script Web App in `SVMI_Project/Apps Script/` (see
`ARCHITECTURE.md`). `MASTER_LOG` (permanent visit history) and `SETTINGS`
(now a generated compatibility mirror for Stores/Visitors/Purposes, still
independently authoritative for admin access — see `DATA_MODEL.md`) are
the live storage. **No PostgreSQL database is live for the application** —
`database/` is a DEV-only, unproven-in-production migration target.

## What has been completed

**Apps Script track** (chronological; full detail in `IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`):
Phase 0/0.5 hardening → Phase 1A configuration engine → Phase 1B Store ID
identity → Phase 1C reporting-year abstraction → Phase 1D Risk/Compliance/KPI
configuration → Phase 1E report snapshots → Phase 1F Admin/Snapshot UI →
**Phase 1G: Admin Configuration made the sole authoritative path for
Stores/Visitors/Purposes; "Store & Roster Manager" removed** → a read-only
System Peripherals architectural audit (findings below).

**Database track**: PostgreSQL DEV schema (13 migrations + rollback
scripts), proven against a local ephemeral instance, including verified
column-level grant enforcement. Phase 2 real-data migration dry-run
tooling (Store/Visitor/Purpose identity reconciliation, operational
readiness, snapshot/integrity validation) built and unit-tested against
synthetic data — **158/158 passing** as of this check.

## What is currently being worked on

Nothing is mid-implementation. The most recent unit of work (Phase 1G)
is complete, tested, and pushed. This documentation-compliance pass is
itself the current task.

## What remains unresolved (System Peripherals gaps — see `reviews/`)

- **No Admin Configuration screen for admin access** — guest password
  (`SETTINGS!I2`) and admin email list (`SETTINGS!G2:G`) are edited only
  by direct cell edit or a one-time Sheets-menu bootstrap (D-007).
- **Approved Brands/Regions/Categories are hardcoded** JS constants with
  no configuration screen; Brand is additionally embedded in Executive
  Summary's fixed row layout (D-013).
- **`CONFIG_KPI` is unwired** — target/weight/type fields are stored,
  validated, and editable, but no KPI calculation reads any of them.
- **`CONFIG_RISK`'s Low Threshold is a dead field** — stored and
  validated, never compared against by the scoring algorithm.
- **Two dropdown-sourcing rules disagree within the same Admin Store
  form**: Region/Category use the full approved list; Brand uses only
  "brands currently in use by some store," inherited unmodified from the
  removed Store & Roster Manager.
- **Store Category and Compliance's category key are only loosely
  linked** — nothing enforces that a Compliance rule's category string
  corresponds to a selectable Store category.
- Legacy dead code: `_countIfs()` and the `DATA_YEAR` literal it uses have
  no live caller.

## What is explicitly deferred

- Moving admin access into `CONFIG_SYSTEM` (D-007).
- Making Brand/Region/Category admin-configurable (D-013) — deferred
  until after the admin-access gap, given Brand's larger blast radius.
- Wiring `CONFIG_KPI` into an actual calculation.
- A real PostgreSQL production deployment or any real-data migration
  (D-011) — paused pending a direct data export from the project owner.
- A separate `location_id` concept (D-002).

## Immediate next task

**This documentation/workflow-compliance checkpoint.** No implementation
work should begin until this checkpoint is reviewed and accepted. The
recommended next *implementation* phase (for after acceptance) is listed
in the review artifact (`reviews/001-workflow-documentation-compliance.md`),
in dependency order, starting with the admin-access Configuration screen.
